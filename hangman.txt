       Short Description: The classic game of Hangman (v1.03b)
        Long Description: This game is a quick and dirty attempt at throwing together a game using Speedsoft's Sibyl.  The games allows several options including picking sounds for different game events.  Hangman includes a file of words, but allows for interactivly entering words or using a different list of words.  Version 1.03b fixed a problem with selecting the sound file name in the
configuration dialog.
